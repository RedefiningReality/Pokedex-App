## Problem Statements
- Pokemon enthusiasts, who do not remember every Pokémon character, with Android smartphones can use this application and take a photo of any gen 1 pokemon and be provided with its name, type, and attributes (its Pokedex information) so that they may easily be able to know which Pokemon to use in battles and learn more about the Pokemon in general.
- New viewers of the first season of the Pokemon anime, who may not be familiar with every Pokémon's ability, could use this Android smartphone app to take an image of a frame of the anime, crop the image to only contain the pokemon in question, and be provided with the Pokémon's pokedex entry.
