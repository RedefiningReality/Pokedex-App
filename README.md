# Pokedex-App
Using AI, take a picture of an unknown Pokémon and learn about its attributes. Completed for IPRO 497 at Illinois Tech
## Problem Statement
Pokémon enthusiasts can use this application and take a photo of any gen 1 pokemon and be provided with its name, type, and attributes (its pokedex information) so that they may easily be able to know which Pokemon to use in battles and learn more about the Pokemon in general.

## Customer
### Description
Any aspiring Pokémon enthusiast, Pokémon game player, or watcher of Pokémon anime, especially those who don't have much prior Pokémon experience.

### Other customer(s) or stakeholder(s)
- Diehard Pokémon fans who want to check their knowledge or work on memorizing new Pokémon stats
- New Pokémon fans who do not yet know every Pokémon but want to learn more
- Companies like Nintendo and Gamefreak because it facilitates use of their games/products
- Competitive Pokémon players who need quick and easy access to information about each of their Pokémon

## Application Type
Mobile application that can be used on smartphones and tablets equipped with a camera.
 
### Tech stack

#### Client Tech (Frontend)
- Smartphone (Android or iOS)
- Camera
- [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) which creates apps using [Python](https://www.python.org/)

#### Server Tech (Backend)
- PC (desktop or laptop) for development
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) in [Python](https://www.python.org/) for Yolov4 object detection

## Top Application Capabilities (name at least 5)
1. Take a photo within the application
2. Identify each Pokémon in the photo
3. Allow user to select an identified Pokémon
4. Describe the selected Pokémon to the user
5. Text-to-Speech description (secondary)
6. In-Battle move recommender (secondary)

## Top Two Scenarios

### Scenario #1
Bob is playing Pokémon and encounters one that he does not know the stats for in battle. He doesn't know which of his Pokémon would pair up well against this Pokémon. He downloads the Pokedex App and takes a picture of the unknown Pokémon he encountered. The app then shows him all the relevant stats and information about this Pokémon. He then looks at which Pokémon he has available and decides which one to use in battle.

### Scenario #2
Bob was watching a Pokémon anime for the first time and was fascinated by their abilities. He was unfamiliar with some of those Pokémon and wanted to learn more about them. Bob used the Pokedex application to take pictures of the Pokémon in the show and found out who they are as well as some fun facts about each one. Bob is happy.

## Team Working Agreement
### What do we want to accomplish/learn together?
- Develop a working application
- Learn how to use the Kivy framework to develop Android and iOS applications
- Use machine learning tools to facilitate object detection
- Learn how to use the Agile framework to develop an application from scratch

### Tools
- We will use Google Docs to collaboratively formulate our ideas.
- We will use Google Drive to exchange required files in instances where this might make more sense than uploading them to our GitHub repository.
- We will use GitHub for version control. Team-members will push their finished code to a branch to ensure the main branch remains bug-free.
- If we need to meet outside of class we will meet mornings on any day, later evening (after 7:30pm) Friday or on weekends. A time can be decided as necessary in the Discord.
- If we need to meet outside of class we will use the following tool/tech for meetings: Discord text/voice chat
- When we are not meeting together we will use the following tools/tech for communications:
  - [Discord Server](http://discord.gg/9uT9jFDy)
  - Email:

### Requested Approach/Behavior
- We will communicate respectfully in a professional manner. Discussions only. No arguing/name calling of any kind. Respect the ideas of each team member.
- We will divide work fairly. Each member will be responsible for the work they choose to be assigned to (based on their skillset). Each member should be assigned to one or more stories on the Kanban board.

### Unacceptable behavior
- No one member will be forced to take all the work upon themselves. No member will take work upon themselves without permission of the rest of the group.
- We will not make comments that are disrespectful or potentially harmful towards fellow team members.
- There will be no plagiarism of any of the code without giving due credit to the author.

### How will we productively solve disagreement
- We will make sure everyone has a voice and the opportunity to share their ideas.
- We will discuss all possible solutions as well as the pros and cons.
- We will attempt to come to a mutual agreement on how to approach the problem.
- If we cannot come to a mutual agreement between all members, it will be put to a majority vote.
