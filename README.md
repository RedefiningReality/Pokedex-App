# Pokedex-App
Using AI, take a picture of an unknown Pokémon and learn about its attributes. Completed for IPRO 497 at Illinois Tech
## Problem Statements
- Pokémon enthusiasts, who do not remember every Pokémon character, can use this application and take a photo of any gen 1 pokemon and be provided with its name, type, and attributes (its Pokedex information) so that they may easily be able to know which Pokemon to use in battles and learn more about the Pokemon in general.
- New viewers of the first season of the Pokémon anime, who may not be familiar with every Pokémon's ability, could use this app to take an image of a frame from the anime and be provided with the pokedex entry for each of the Pokémon in that image.
